# FRUIT IDENTIFICATION USING RESENT9 ARCHITECTURE BASED CNN DEEP LEARNING MODELüçÖüçáüçâüçåüçíüçìü•ëü•ùü•≠

Fruits are very good source of Nutrients and Fiber. They are juicy & sweet and also impart Freshness in our diet.
As important it is to eat foods, it is also very important to identify what fruit are we exactly eating, sometimes people with conditions require fruits which are rich in some particular Nutrient or Fiber.

The very aim of this Deep learning Model is to predict the label/name of the given Fruit just by looking at it's Picture.
